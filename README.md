My current work can be categorised into three types:
* Develop deep learning models for medical imageing data
  * Organ / tumour segmentation
  * Radiomics feature engineering
  * Survival analysis and treatment response prediction
* Test and deploy data system for clinical use
  * Medical data curation, conversion and warehousing
* Develop tools to help speed up the workflow
  * Automate registration
  * Convert DICOM (RT) data
